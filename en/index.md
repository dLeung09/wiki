# David's Wiki

## Overview

This wiki serves as a space for my how-to articles, recipes, and anything else I may want to write down for later.

Below describes the different sections of wiki.


## How-To Articles

This section provides instruction articles I've written, either as a reminder on how I've done things or as a space for me to share instructions for simple tasks to multiple friends/family.

Note: I've done my best to make these instructions as accurate and easy to follow as possible, but your mileage may vary. Follow at your own risk


## Recipes

This section is a collection of recipes that I have found and either want to try, or have tried and decided worth keeping.

As of now, there is no organization scheme. In the future I'd like to introduce some logical structure to the recipes. Some potential schemas are:

* Meat source (e.g. chicken, beef, pork, etc.)
* Meal type (e.g. breakfast, dinner, snack, etc.)
* Ingredients (e.g. pasta, casserole, meat with carb, etc.)
* Combination of above?


## Scratchpad

This section acts as a space for me to jot down collections of thoughts that are not fully formed yet, but I don't want to forget.
